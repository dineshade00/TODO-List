#Project Description 

Project Live Link : https://dineshade00.github.io/TODO-List/

This is a simple and interactive To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks in an intuitive interface.

Technologies Used:

HTML5 for structuring the task list and input forms
CSS3 for layout and styling the to-do list with modern UI components
JavaScript for task management (adding, marking as complete, and deleting tasks)
Key Features:

Add Task: Users can add tasks through an input field, which are immediately displayed on the list.
Mark as Complete: Tasks can be marked as complete, with a visual strike-through effect.
Delete Task: Tasks can be removed from the list when no longer needed.
Local Storage Support: The tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
Design:

Clean and simple design for an easy-to-use interface.
Includes basic CSS for task highlighting and status change animations.
Fully responsive design that works well on all screen sizes.
This project demonstrates basic front-end development skills and can be extended with additional features such as task filtering or deadlines.
